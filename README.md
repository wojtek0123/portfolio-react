## Personal Portfolio project

#### Built with my lately favourite combination of technologies:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

#### This web app isn't common site because there isn't vertical scrolling on desktops, only horizontal. User can navigation using buttons in the right and left edge of the screen or use standard navigation in the top of the screen.

#### In the near future I will implement graphCMS to can easly manage my projects.

### [Live](https://portfolio-wojtek.vercel.app/)

#### Todo:

- [x] graphCMS
- [ ] typing animation for Hello in the header
- [x] scroll spy
- [x] horizontal scrolling on mouse scroll
